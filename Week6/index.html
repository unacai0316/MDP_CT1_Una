        <h2>Lucy: Don't eat cat poop!!</h2>
        <div id="gameCanvas"></div>
        <p>Welcome to the game where you control Lucy, the rectangular dog, as she jumps to collect bones and avoid obstacles (cat poop). 
            Press "a" on keyboard to make Lucy jump and try to score as many points as possible without losing all your lives!</p>
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>The design process of this game is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine the game theme: Choose the dog character Lucy as the protagonist, with the main goal of collecting bones and avoiding cat poop.</li>
            <li>Design Lucy's character. <img id="gameAssets" src="images/IMG_2904.jpg" alt="Game Assets"></li>
            <li>Draw UML diagrams and flowcharts: Plan the game's logic and class relationships to ensure system scalability and maintainability.

            </li>
            <li>Draw Lucy on p5.js first. <img id="gameAssets" src="images/drawlucy.jpg" alt="Game Assets"></li>
            <li>Implement game logic using p5.js: Create different classes (such as Lucy, bones, and cat poop) through object-oriented programming and add behaviors and properties to them.<img id="gameAssets_big" src="images/game1.png" alt="Game Assets"></li>
            <li>I couldn't fix the bug of lucy.js not correctly detecting the touch with bones and poop so I had to make Lucy a simple square than a cute character.</li>
            <li>Add user interaction: Allow players to control the weather to change the difficulty of the game. The better the weather the easier it is: Lucy could jump higher and less cat poop emerging too.</li>
        </ol>
