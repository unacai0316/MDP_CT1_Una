    <h2>Evolution of Work</h2>
    
    <div class="iteration">
        <h3>Iteration 1: Basic Setup</h3>
        <img src="/images/01.png" alt="Basic setup with canvas">
        <p>Initial setup of the canvas with a simple flower and basic circular motion for bees. The shapes were basic geometric forms without organic movement.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="iteration">
        <h3>Iteration 2: Organic Shapes</h3>
        <img src="/images/02.png" alt="Organic shapes added">
        <p>Introduced the drawOrganicShape function to create more natural-looking forms for both the flower and bees. This added a slight "wobble" effect to the shapes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="iteration">
        <h3>Iteration 3: Enhanced Organic Movement</h3>
        <img src="/images/03.jpg" alt="Enhanced organic movement">
        <p>Improved the organic movement by increasing the range of shape deformation and adding individual noise offsets for each shape part. This created more distinct and natural-looking movements.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="iteration">
        <h4>Iteration 4: Color Changes and Transparency</h4>
        <img src="/images/04.jpg" alt="Color changes and transparency">
        <p>Implemented color changing for both bees and flower. bees' body change within yellowish, wings change within blueish, Flower change within warm colors.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="iteration">
        <h3>Iteration 5: Detailed Bee Anatomy</h3>
        <img src="/images/05.jpg" alt="Detailed bee anatomy">
        <p>Added more details to the bees, including eyes(white/black), a sting, and more defined wings(translate/rotate). Each part of the bee now has its own organic shape and movement, creating a dumb and cute visual.

        Created "drawOrganicTriangle" function to draw the sting of the bee!
        </p>

        <h3>Iteration 6: Fine-tuning and Performance</h3>
        <img src="/images/06.jpg" alt="Fine-tuned animation">
        <p>After I embbed the scipt into the webpage I noticed bees were moving too fast so I narrowed down the random range of "bee.speed", now the sketch won't easily make you dizzy.</p>
