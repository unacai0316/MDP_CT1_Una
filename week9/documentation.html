                <p>It works. I was successfully detected as something else, but the detection was always changing. I want it to be locked in unless I want it to be re-detected.</p>

                <p>Trying to fix the constant changing detection thing. Added a button to re-detect "person". The detection was successfully locked as long as I don't move too much. If I moved it'd re-detect.(related to gridSize explained below)</p>

                <p>This function create an ID for the person and by adjusting "gridSize" I can determine if I want people moving around to have different objects. For example when my head is on the top I'm "a", and when I'm in the center I'm "b". Right now I changed the gridSize to "500" (a lot), so I can move around and my transformation object won't change.</p>

                <p>I set the threshold to very low and list out up to 20 results, but I could still only got "person".</p>

                WHY?</strong><br/>
                Because Mediapipe object detector is better at detecting object position, not what the object could look like.<br/>
                <strong>MobileNet Image Classification,</strong><br/>
                on the other hand, is good at giving out different posibilities but doesn't have the position(x,y) info.</p>
